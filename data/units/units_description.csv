archimedes,"Aging considerably, the Archimedes class remains formidable at long range, where it's arsenal of capital missiles of design more modern than itself maintain its martial standing with assistance from recent upgrades to the main battery of beam weapons and fully modern sensor equipment. However, limited time, resources, and fundamental design issues have meant that the rest of the ship shows the age of the design enough that the survivability of the craft is not as high as it once was, even if the offensive impact has increased."

Lubricants,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Much to the dismay of all mechanical systems, friction cannot be overcome. Much to the delight of all users of mechanical systems, great advances have been made in mitigating friction's undesired effects."
Spare_Parts,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While the mean time to failure of solid-state components tends to be measured in decades, this does not tend to account for the type and degree of abuse that consumers will pile on their belongings."
Aerospace_Ground_Equipment,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While only small to medium sized craft are capable of planetary landing, the abuse taken by a spaceport due to dropships and other forms of cargo delivery requires that an elaborate array of maintenance equipment, spare parts, and freight loaders must be kept on hand at all times."
Aerospace_Repair_Equipment,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@The special materials used in aerospace construction require special equipment for repair and maintenance. Given the dire frequencies of pirate attacks and other sources of damage, this equipment is in high demand."
Atmospheric_Scrubbers,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Atmostpheric scrubbers consist of a series of screens, containers and filters to remove toxic wastes from an artificial atmosphere. As few if any spaceborn craft have an effective contained ecology, they require such artifical means of providing a sustained breathable atmosphere."
Welding_Supplies,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Though few know what their true purpose is, there always seem to be govenment projects in every colony that primarily consist of tearing up infrastructure and welding big metal plates over the holes until some second agency comes by a few years later to replace whatever was ripped out. There's also the whole starship construction buisness, but one wonders which is the bigger market."
Self_Contained_Hydroponics,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@With the dawn of space travel, hydroponics wasn't just for growing herbs in your closet anymore."
Bulk_Seeds,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Even if mono-culture is the name of the game, and automation of farms is nearly total, all non-native crops must still be brought in through interstellar shipping, and most agricultural colonies tend to lack the genetic research facilities to produce their own variants."
Herbicides,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Many planets have species that make kudzu look like a houseplant. These planets therefore also have markets full of colonists looking for some practical defoliants."
Hydroponic_Supplies,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Growing plants in a liquid solution offers flexibility in placement relative to soil planting. Especially useful in environments that do not actually have soil."
Pesticides,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@No matter where one goes, it seems that every world capable of supporting life supports at least one species that is exceptionally annoying to whatever civilization attempts to colonize it. The age-old solution to this problem is to kill said species. Admittedly, doing so in a fashion that doesn't manage to hurt the colonists is still a subject of intense research. However, any pesticide producer will proudly claim that having a few babies born with the wrong number of legs is surely a small price to pay for not having disfiguring holes in all of the world's crops."
Synthetic_Fertilizer,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@When synthetic fertilizer became not only better, but cheaper and less smelly than those based on manure, few regretted switching over."
Engineered_Seeds,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Genetically enhanced cropseed developed to remain fertile in some particular form of hostile soil, and to render the native lifeforms of that planet more edible. Luddite terrorists still protest the use of such products, despite the inability of many existing populations to otherwise feed themselves."
Boring_Droids,"@cargo/boring_droids.png@Construction of mine shafts has never been so easy. Just let a few of these know where you want the tunnels, and come back a few days later to find huge mounds of debris a delightfully polished passageway."
Laser_Drills,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While the precise nature of the cuts produced by this drill add to its usefulness, it is fact that lasers never get dull or snagged on dense ore deposits that has caused the laser drill to replace all other competitors."
Light_Alls,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@There are few things more terrifying to an asteroid miner than the classic scene from the holovid movie 'The Dark Rock', wherein a group of asteroid miners' standard light droid loses power, and they are attacked by a hideous alien awoken by their mining. While no voracious aliens have ever actually been found in an asteroid mine, reality has never been been a particularly key component of marketing strategy."
Utility_Vehicles,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@The ability to lift large masses and manipulate them dextrously in three dimensions is essential for construction and lacking in all known sentient beings. These machines make up for the shortcomings of biology."
PreFab_Buildings,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Unless one is absurdly wealthy, one lives in a building made out of modular components just like these."
Landscaping_Equipment,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@For when that hill is blocking your view, you want to recreate your garden surrounds in the latest style, or just want to cover up that unsightly nuclear waste dump."
BioApplicator,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Essentially a vat full of genetically engineered bacteria with some valves and a spray nozzle, this device is used to create and apply the complex proteins that the Rlaan use as a basic construction material. When the goop sprayed out of the nozzle reacts with the methane atmosphere present on nearly all Rlaan worlds, the proteins produced by the bacteria denature into the desired solid form."
BioRemodeler,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@This device applies a set of enzymes that sufficiently liquify the organics used in most Rlaan construction so that they can be altered."
First_Aid_Kits,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While the contents have changed countless times, these kits can be found in every public transport and in every overprotective mother's travel bags."
Aera_First_Aid_Kit,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Given their somewhat similar chemical makeup, the Aera First-Aid kit contains many items similar or analogous to those found in a Human kit. Of noteworthy exception, however, is the standard issue in all Aera packs of a suicide pill marked with a lable that translates to 'For use in conjunction with eventually terminal trauma.'"
Pseudotherms,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@The Aera originated on a warm world, and are subject to episodes of reduced functionality if caught unprepared in a frigid environment. These coveralls are packed with shielded isotopes and spectral converters that are guaranteed to warm an Aera back up to body temperature within a few minutes."
DNA_Resequencer,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@This portable device can take any DNA sample and transcribe it into the more familiar Rlaan analogs so that it may be more conveniently analyzed."
Rlaan_Cellular_Regrowth_Accelerant,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A gel pack of complex organic muck that when applied to the site of an injury, will greatly increase the rate of a Rlaan's healing process."
Cryogenic_Supplies,"@cargo/cryogenic_pods.png@For the last thousand years humans have been freezing themselves (or their heads) in the hope that they will one day be revived. While the oddsmakers on New Vegas tend to see the survival rate ever breaking fifty/fifty as too close to call one way or the other, it is clear that our ability to freeze things has advanced rather more rapidly than our ability to defrost them."
Regen_Tank,"@cargo/regen_tank.png@With advances in cellular research, the medical establishment has been able to restore lost or damaged cellular material. They have not, however, figured out how to stop the replacement part from itching the entire time it's growing back..."
Syringes,"@cargo/vaccines.png@Although no longer necessary for most rational purposes, certain segments of the medical community seem to still gain some perverse pleasure from jamming large hollow needles into their fellow beings."
Vaccines,"@cargo/vaccines.png@With interstellar trade and war, the risk of infection from dangerous diseases and biological weapons requires vaccinations against every conceivable threat."
Altered_Strains,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While the Rlaan are masters of genetic manipulation, the Aera are decided amateurs, and are behind most of humanity in this area of research. In particular, they have only recently taken measures to artificially expand the gene pool of their own species."
Implant_tolerance_enhancements,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Although tending to be more physically gifted than the other dominant species, the Aera suffer from high rejection rates of mechanical implants due to their overzealous immune systems."
Bio_Adapters,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@The Rlaan are more skilled than any other known species at the production of altered organisms, but are still working on perfecting organo-mechanical interface units.  One tends to believe success at the first has hindered funding towards the second."
Bio_Splicers,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Hand-held retro-viral incubation and insertion device. Testing still in the Beta stage - namely, not on Rlaan"
Surgical_Techniques,"@cargo/surgical_techniques.png@The medical establishements of all species can appreciate the development of any techniques that are more discussed by surgeons than by lawyers."
Engineered_Bacteria,"@cargo/engineered_bacteria.png@Engineered bacteria have been used for over a millenia - but the set of tasks gets bigger every year."
Synthetic_Limbs,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Fully functional synthetic limbs are old hat. Cheap fully functional synthetic limbs that are far better than the originals and indistinguishable from their native organic counterparts are far more interesting things."
Experimental_Drugs,"@cargo/experimental_drugs.png@When a Lilipution Lime-leech is lunching on your liver, you don't care if or what the drugs were tested on."
Nano_Constructors,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While the devices themselves, due to the Nano-plague, are decidedly macro-scale, they are capable of constructing nearly anything with atomic precision."
Self_Repairing_Metal,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@By embedding sensor nets and electrical delivery systems, sheets of metal can be produced that will compensate for any cracking or deformation by selectively heating portions of themselves with exceptional precision."
Automated_Factories,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@As expensive as AI cores are, sets of orbiting factories tend to be even more expensive. The trick, and gist of many a grant proposal, is to figure out how to convince an AI to do something as boring as operate a holovid factory..."
Atmospheric_Rejuvinator,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Whether it be because of overindustrialization or innate unpleasantness, if a planetary atmosphere is not to one's liking, deploying a few million of these (or a few dozen for a domed community)can do wonders."
Ozone_Healer,"@cargo/ozone_replacement.png@Many electronic devices naturally produce ozone. However, as most of these devices tend to be grounded, they do not contribute to the accretion of an ozone layer at high altitude. A recently arrived at solution: move lots of electronic devices out to the ozone layer on high efficiency flying platforms. These are the platforms."
Forest_Regenerator,"@cargo/forest_regenerators.png@While many civilized races, with the notable exception of the Aera, would love to see their ancestral forests of old regrown, nearly all are uninclined to do much work towards this goal. Therefore, some effort has been made into producing autonomous forest tending units that can oversee the regrowth of an ecosystem without anyone having to get their manipulator appendages dirty."
(Xeno)forming_Units,"@cargo/terraforming_units.png@For humans, terraformers, for every other species, something else - for the targeted planet underneath them, truly an alien transformation. Incorporating atmospheric processing, development of a viable biosphere, and creation of potable liquids, xenoforming units are automated monstrocities that can be landed on a hostile planet surface. Given enough time, any airless desert of sufficient size can be made into a golf-course and a strip mall."
Quantum_Deductor,"@cargo/quantum_deductor.png@The ever so polite name for the class of devices used to attack quantum cryptosystems."
Virtual_Tunneling_Terminal,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A device used for viewing and traversing the internals of macro-scale objects via tunneling effects."
Quantum_Computers,"@cargo/quantum_processor.png@Featuring massive parallelism and minute feature size, a top of the line number cruncher can analyze more useless facts about its user in a second than most users desire to know in a lifetime."
Consoles,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Of the many interfaces between organics and machines, species specific variants of the Nazduc console produced on various Unadorned worlds remain among the most popular."
Microprocessors,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A vital component of every consumer product since the dawn of ubiquitous computing, microprocessors, though individually near worthless, are in exceptional demand as bulk products."
Protocol_Droids,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Trained in the nuances of interspecies relations, these machines are valued accessories for both diplomats and far ranging merchants - provided they can figure out how to make the damned things shut up when not in use."
Robotic_Laborers,"@cargo/robot_workers.png@Tireless laborers that will attempt to do nearly anything you can convey to them as their task. Unfortunately, in order to keep costs down, their ability to understand exactly what it is you were trying to convey is somewhat limited. NOTE: Certain aberrations with this particular model have been noticed in conjunction with the request 'lend me a hand'. Please refrain from issuing this command."
Enhanced_Limbs,"@cargo/enhanced_limbs.png@When the limbs of a sentient being are just not up to the job, fiber enhancements, neuro drivers and bone reinforcing increases function by several orders of magnitude."
Enhanced_Organs,"@cargo/enhanced_organs.png@Sometimes genecrafting alone cannot provide the benefits desired."
Artificial_Limbs,"@cargo/artificial_limbs.png@We have the technology - we can rebuild him."
Cyborg_Construction_Workers,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While, in most cultures, granted a set of rights nearly indistinguishable from normal organics, due to the bulky, less than aesthetically pleasing attachments most construction cyborgs are equipped with, transportation regulations welcome their being shipped in cargo holds."
Cyborg_Defenders,"@cargo/cyborg_mercs.png@The modern day equivalent to the private security officers of old, these cyborgs tend to be somewhat more cost effective, if somewhat less pleasant to stand next to. So they ride in the cargo hold instead..."
Pleasure_Borgs,"@cargo/pleasure_borgs.png@Pleasure cyborgs, differentiated from pleasure bots by having real skin and systems to keep said skin alive, are sufficiently non-sapient that they may be freely bought and sold.  That being said, they still don't like being shoved into the closet every time grandma comes to visit."
PAI_Wetware,"@cargo/pai_wetware.png@Pseudo-Artificial Intelligence. PAIs are wet-ware embedded in hardware - genetically engineered brain-in-boxes that distribute the tasks of thinking between the organic and inorganic components. Commercial PAIs are almost universally designed as idiot-savant systems, capable of limited self-motivation and direction, easy to manipulate, but capable of extraordinary problem solving power for the problems they were designed for and trained to assault. PAIs tend to be able to present more natural user interfaces than the expert systems they compete with, tending to be at least vaguely self-aware, and much more responsive to and on emotional levels. In particular, niche market and custom built models are limited only by legislation requiring that entities surpassing a specified set of standardized metrics cannot be considered property, and must be registered as either custom children or custom dependent employees. While the difference is clear for low end models, standards aside, most will agree that the line between a high-end PAI and a designer cyborg human is exceptionally blurry."
Neural_Interface,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@The true pulse of an Andolian is not the calm beating of her heart, but the rampaging datastream of her mind."
Jewelry,"@cargo/jewelry.png@All but entirely useless, except as art or in dating simulations. Still, there will always be a demand for items suitable for decadent expenditure."
Carpets,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Carpets, albeit of far less dust loving varieties, have made their way into space primarily because large slabs of metal are cold to walk on."
Furniture,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@No matter what their size or shape, all corporeal beings need something to park their butt-equivalent on."
Home_Appliances,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@From the esoteric hover-masseuse to the ubiquitous InstaNuker, these are the champions of eternal consumerism."
Hygiene_Supplies,"@cargo/personal_hygienics.png@As advanced as the sentient races have become, they have not escaped the need for a good scrubbing up every once and a while. Cremes and balms promise to use the latest advances in nanoscale chemical transport to remove wrinkles and provide superior skin tone, anti-esthers seek out and destroy unpleasant scent particles, and orifice specific probes prevent awkward mucus excretions."
Janitorial_Supplies,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While most developed worlds are moving away from using living janitors, the need for chemical cleansers and means to apply them has not changed."
Textiles,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@No matter how far technology has advanced, there will always be those who desire to the freedom to make their own kilt."
Clothing,"@cargo/clothing.png@Despite the proselytizing efforts of the adherents of the Trekie religion, the unitard never did catch on. Clothing in all manner of make and manufacture can be found in most any region of inhabited space."
Robot_Servants,"@cargo/robot_servants.png@Having the abilities of a simple-minded bodyservant and portable data storage unit, these machines are valued accessories for those too poor or too ethical to use human servants."
Personal_Transport,"@cargo/personal_transport.png@Despite the best efforts of government to encourage people to do so, they still tend not to take public transit or transport-pool."
IntaTouch,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A tactile simulator that reminds provides an Aera with relaxing sensations."
VirtuArea,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A wall hanging that projects the illusion of open space."
Books,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@While the manner of its conveyance has gone through countless alterations over untold millenia, few things compare to a well crafted tale."
Games,"@cargo/games.png@Providing near endless possibility for gameplay and maximizing entertainment return, interactive computer games are a market fueled by the hard labors of underfunded dreamers. Despite their lack of fiscal resources they still manage to produce high quality products and garner wide fan bases. These fan bases could theoretically provide support for the poor, downtrodden programmers and content providers, but strangely they never seem to."
Holo_Vids,"@cargo/holovids.png@Mindless entertainment for the masses. Especially popular among those with no noticeable social life. This year's top seller on the Confederation frontier: 'Who's your Dgn?: Interspecies Fantasies XXIV'. And, as always, the top seller in High Born space: 'Birth of a Nation II.'"
Rare_Artwork,"@cargo/rare_artwork.png@Wonderfully handcrafted with near-forgotton techniques and wonderously copied with exceptionally well known ones. 'Dogs playing poker', 'Rlaan plays it by trust', and replicas of mid 21st century CE Terran plastic food storage units are among the more popular items of this type."
Erotica,"@cargo/erotica.png@If you have to ask, this terminal judges you too young to be told."
Resistant_biologics,"@cargo/resistant_biologics.png@While of potential legitimate use for research, these pathogens are deemed too dangerous to transport, if only because someone willing to use them might intercept them."
Illegal_Weapons,"@cargo/hp_weapons.png@While it may seem odd, given the loose nature of the laws governing what armaments may be placed on civilian ships, certain weapons, such as thermonuclear mortars, hunter-killer drones, and Anchadaen wrestling worms, are not allowed to be carried around by the civilians of any known political entity deserving of the title. This does not prevent groups and individuals from desiring the aquisition of such devices."
Pilot,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Much as you may hate the pilot of the ship that attempted to destroy yours, destroying that pilot's ship does not grant one, under interstellar law, the right to sell said pilot into slavery. That being said, many have been known to justify such actions by claiming it to be an entirely proper form of remuneration. [Note to editors: Do not change name as the code relies on Pilot]"
Slaves,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Illegal due to fears of interspecies domination, among a plethora of other reasons, economic inefficiencies looming largest of all."
Clones,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@It is illegal to transport clones as mass cargo. Each clone must book individual passage at cabin rate on a certified civilian transport. Exceptions may be granted for clones under the age of gestation."
ISO_Propaganda,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A fair portion of it's true a fair portion of the time, but all of it's illegal all of the time."
ISO_Party_Member,"@cargo/iso_member.png@Anyone in Confederation space willing to openly declare their membership in the ISO either has great fortitude or suffers from great idiocy. The same however, must be said of those willing to transport them through said space."
Socialist_Worker_Journal,"@cargo/swj.png@The Socialist Worker Journal is a bi-monthly electronic publication believed to have its origins on Berkeley in the Trotsky system. The SWJ highlights the importance of advancing socialism, and features artwork and music produced by workers, for workers. This product has been officially deemed 'unworthy for use even in the task of wiping one's rear.'"
Luddite_Religious_Tracts,"@cargo/luddite_tracts.png@Carrying ISO propaganda will get one arrested.  Carrying luddite propaganda, outside of the more sympathetic Purist regions, is likely to get one summarily shot."
Escaped_Political_Prisoners,"@cargo/political_prisoners.png@Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the ISO?"
Overeager_Immigrants,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@With the passing of the Confederation's so called 'Enough is Enough' legislation, it is illegal to transport individuals whose stated purpose is to settle on a planet deemed to have already reached its maximum desired population. While many decried the legislative package as both idiotic and unenforceable and hearings on the act dragged on for years, the coalition of Purists, High Born, Shapers, and various minor factions prevailed over the opposition of the Andolians and the Merchants, with the Unadorned not deigning to participate in the discussion."
ICBINF,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Originally designed as a cheap, renewable, and environmentally friendly refrigerant, it was found to induce exceptionally terminal cancers in Rlaan."
Zhollus,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@A plant-like lifeform that, while exceptionally tasty to a Rlaan, is exceptionally devastating to a Rlaan friendly ecosystem."
RetrifiedSalt,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Salted crematory remains. Illegal in Aera space due to the combination of a cultural disdain for such and an unwillingness to remove an ancient law from the books."
AeraNerveStimuli,"@cargo/cargo-hud.png@Ever watched an Aera spasm in something that looks like a cross between an epileptic fit and an orgasm?  Give them some of this and sit back. Way back. Preferably behind a barrier, because when the Aera in question starts to go into withdrawl induced fits of berserker rage, you might live to tell the tale."
