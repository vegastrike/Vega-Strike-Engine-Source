	          a) if you are buying, you have x as much as that thing costs.
	             if life were fair you'd pay 1-x the price...but you prolly
		     end up buying 1-.5*x the cost or something
		  b) If you are selling then you get that much back 
	   	     (times .5 or so relating to difficuly for used part)
		  c) If you are adding to your part (eg adding armor)
		     x is 0 so you pay full price (because it adds on)

2001-10-24 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* added Turrets to the scenes.  They may use any preconcieved AI script, but right now they just load "turntowards" and "fireat" target
	* made an ifdef to allow the user to fly a turret  #ifdef IPILOTTURRET
	* IFLYTURRET will only work if the unit in question has a turret
	* add turrets as follows:  	<Subunit file="rapier" y="10" ri="0" rj="1" rk="0" pi="0" pj="0" pk="1" restricted="-.5"/>
	* turrets may not use their own type for a turret...
	* retricted means dot with "Ri,Rj,Rk" vector must be greater than that value  (so turrets can't turn inside a hull)

	* modified sounds to either go in the current dir or <data>/sounds
	* modified animations to go in <currentdir>/animations
	* modified sprites to go in <currentdir>/sprites
	* allowed flat data directories too :-)

	* changed the number of times the sound's location was updated to once every physics phase
	* fixed  a problem with weapons (one that had been there for a while) that weapons would be fired by the AI script and not be aligned to a physics frame... this produced a somewhat cool but undesirable effect to have the weapons seem to carry with them a lot of inertia  so I made the unit remember when a shot was fired, and then instead "fire it" at the physics frame 
	* problem caused: because the physics frame deals with the "next" frame instead of this one....  so I had to use the saved data from the previous frame...which is somewhat inaccurate as I do not know the parent of this unit (may cause problems with a turret on a wildly evading starship)


2001-10-21 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* added Sound support
	* added buffers share preloaded sounds
