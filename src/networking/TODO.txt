*** GENERAL ************************************************************

- Add a test in the process of downloading webcam from other client to ensure we are in WEBCAM mode on left VDU
- Replace the string from Systems map with a string *
- Wait for the client to ask to be added after a jump so he can have the time to load its data
- Add a ranking system for each faction in factions.xml
LOPRI - Add a cargo to the netcomm upgrade units and then in UpAndDowngrade stuff look for that
        Have a device (maybe in upgrade list) for networking communications and prevent usage of device if not present on ship

- Switch to the usage of the ZoneMgr::Systems map instead of reading file on demand and then send a buffer to buffer download
- Prediction : predict when receive ClientState on server and then one time again when received on other clients
               how can I compute positions between 2 updates with interpolation ?
- Use crypto++ lib to implement comms encryption
  - TO TEST with RSA
  - with blowfish
  - with 3des
- REMOVE jVoIP support if PortAudio works well
- PortAudio : tune MAX_PA_CPU_LOAD when support is complete
- NOTE : network communication system is only working when 1 local player
- NOTE : Only client with crypto can connect correctly to a crypto server and vice-versa

*** ACCOUNT SERVER *****************************************************

- BUG : continuous loop when gameserver connects to accountserver
- BUG : when account already logged -> game server fails to send info to client
- In client-to-acctserver mode : Handle case where player has no server affected yet

*** GAME SERVER ********************************************************

- Find a caching system that load all units (and creates not only buffers XML) and meshes
- On star system loading : make a buffer with all unit/planet/nebula creation corresponding to the system
- When testing timed out clients if we never received a position update it might be a problem
- Fix ping computation
- Depending on ping -> send the player its own info in order to update himself periodicaly (like 1 time per 2 or 3 seconds)
- Add a timeout between the time the player logged in and the time he really enters the game
- Add options to server keyboard control : KILL A SERVER UNIT, KICK A PLAYER, SEND A PLAYER TO JAIL SYSTEM, SEND ADMIN MESSAGE TO PLAYERS...
- Sometimes in the future : make admin server settings with :
							- no AI wingmen for players
							- do not allow players' capships

- Think about transfering config data such as difficulty, physics...

TO TEST - Check the detlatime we have to send in clientstate (broadcastSnapshot)
TO TEST - try to reconnect to account server periodicaly if connection lost
TO LOOK AT - When receiving a packet : look at timestamp and compare it to latest receive timestamp for that client


*** CLIENT SIDE *********************************************************

- Take damages into account and put some interferences on webcam pictures
  - replace one image on 3 or 5 with blank noise picture
  - scramble one sound buffer on 5 or 10
- Should wait for CMD_ADDEDYOU just before entering in the main game loop
- Interpolate(extrapolate) using delatime + the concerned client's current_state delay
OR
- Maybe send extrapolated position with deltatime ahead in time
- and when receiving position updates extrapolate only with concerned client's delay
- Make client ask each .txt files containing planet, stars, ... textures someday
MAYBE NOT - Make webcam capture size part of config file (and later part of server config, not client anymore)

DONE - Netcomm : Add support for secure channels (encrypt with a key every data send on those channels) add encryption stuff
DONE - Add text message support to NetworkCommunication class : displaying message has to be added
DONE - PORTAUDIO : add calls to Pa_CloseStream in DestroySession
DONE - Server must be aware of webcam and portaudio client abilities
DONE OK - Check if I really send path relative to datadir with filenames to download
DONE - Implement a download manager -> Carsten is on that one
DONE - When client starts server send galaxy filename with md5sum or other check system
	if client has the file and the same md5 -> ok
	if not server sends the file content and client writes it
DONE - Do the same for starsystems at enter time on clients side (even if  starsystem has already been loaded once to check for manual changes)
DONE - Add tests in netbuffer.cpp in order to avoid any segfault (only when the protocol gets stable enough)
DONE - Move the GetUniqueSerial use from accountserver to vegaserver
DONE - In NetBuffer : turn string size into a u_short instead of int (and assert no string length > 0xFFFF

NO BECAUSE DEFAULT TO ZLIB - Put some negociation stage to check that client support zlib


=== ACCOUNT SERVER ======================================================

DONE - Web-based account creation enhancements : fully create an initial savegame
DONE	- has to read faction.xml
DONE	- has to know about a few basic ships (specified by hand ?)
DONE - Load whole system description when generating a system (if not already done)

DONE - Make sure that in script_call_unit_generic.cpp serial is passed to UnitFactory call
DONE - ZoneMgr : use directly star_systems vector and its drawList
DONE - Script call unit : broadcast a message to starsystems' client to make them create units created in script_call_unit.cpp
                     add the created units in the zone's unit list
DONE - Remove unit from star system when docking and add it again when undocking
DONE - netserver_devices.cpp : broadcast CMD_JUMP
DONE - Redo jumps :
  - client asks for a jump and do nothing
  - if client receives a CMD_JUMP ok then it tries to jump (if ok on server should be ok on client)
DONE - Associate serial by replacing strings in .system files (replace "<Planet ", "<Nebula", "<Unit ")
DONE - Add a check just before loading a unit from xml save and loading savegame to check data files for saved ship exist
   if not just deny login and output error on stderr
DONE - In savegame : add stardate loading and saving stuff to dynamic universe
DONE - Handle docking with CMD_DOCK and CMD_UNDOCK and DockToSavedBase on server side
DONE - When a request to jump -> check if the destination is reachable by origin system with UniverseUtil::GetAdjacentSystems()

DONE - Put back a control with keyboard to be able to SAVE, SEE MEMORY USED...
DONE - Add position stuff transmission for other units than clients (ai, missiles)
DONE - Make the difference between ships/ai and planets/bases that move really slowly so updates are not required that often

DONE - Remove time compression in networking
ELIMINATED - BUG : do not broadcast when orientation changes
DONE - Find the jump call and make it only send a jump request to server
DONE - Check if we received position info about us -> ignore
DONE - Add the detection ov Video For Linux or Quicktime in configure.in -> if no present disable webcam (add a NETCOMM_NOCAM const)
MADE POSSIBLE - Ask directly account server for authentication and get serverip/port to connect to
DONE - Write the function that receive damage snapshot
DONE - Do not maintain ClientStates anymore -> maintain Unit members directly
DONE - When receiving position update, test if local player
DONE - When receiving a packet : look at timestamp and compare it to latest receive timestamp from the server
