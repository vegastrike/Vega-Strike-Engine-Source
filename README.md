## Introduction

Vega Strike is a Space Flight Simulator that allows a player to explore, trade, and fight in the vast openness of space. You start in an old beat up cargo ship, with endless possibilities in front of you and just enough cash to scrape together a life. Yet danger lurks in the space beyond.

## Features

- All the art assets are original.
- Never before seen ships modelled by the Vegastrike team!

- Respawn with the ';' key (semicolon)
- Switch Ships with the '[' key
- Joystick support for a full-featured joystick

## How to Run

Either install Vega Strike from the binary installer for your platform, if available, or follow the instructions for compiling from source. (`Compiling Vegastrike`, below.)

- First change settings with `bin/vegasettings`
- Then run `bin/vegastrike-engine`

Vegastrike command line parameters allow for different start settings and are as follows

```man
  vegastrike-engine -ddata_dir [-px,y,z] [-jsector/starsystem] missionname

OPTIONS
  -d/my/data/dir
    specifies /my/data/dir as the path for finding the vega strike data.  Re-
    quired.

  -p1024,2405,1245090101
    Forces  the  player's  starting  location  to  be  at  x=  1024, y= 2405,
    z=1245090101

  -jgemini_sector/troy
    Forces the player to start in the troy system in gemini sector.

  missionname
    Specifies a mission for vegastrike to run. Default is main_menu.mission.
```

Vegastrike takes a single positional parameter indicating which mission it should load

```bash
bin/vegastrike mission/explore_universe.mission -d$(pwd)/../Assets-Production
```

is an example of a valid mission call

the -l flag (must be flushed with the system) will force a player to begin in a star system.

```bash
bin/vegastrike -lvega_sector/vega mission/bomber.mission -d$(pwd)/../Assets-Production
```

will force the bomber mission to run in the vega sector.

### Executable Name Changes

Note that the executable names have changed since the 0.5.x releases. Now, you configure game settings using `vegasettings`, and run the game itself using `vegastrike-engine`. With the latter, the data directory (`-d...`)  is now a required parameter. This is to allow using the Vega Strike Game Engine with multiple games (asset sets), including Upon the Coldest Sea (vsUtCS), PWCU, and others.

Also note that when you install vsUtCS, it comes with a script called `vsettings` that automatically runs `vegasettings` with the correct data directory, and another script called `vs` that automatically runs `vegastrike-engine` with the correct data directory. These scripts are the recommended way to run the game Vega Strike: Upon the Coldest Sea. You should see shortcuts to them on your desktop, Start Menu, or similar.

If you encounter any issues while playing, please create an issue with the Vega Strike development team by [posting a new issue](https://github.com/vegastrike/Vega-Strike-Engine-Source/issues).

### REQUIRED FILES

```bash
  /usr/bin/vegastrike-engine
      The vegastrike engine, requires `-d` to specify the data set.
  /usr/bin/vegastrike
      The vegastrike engine with legacy data set search support
  /usr/local/bin/vsinstall
      The Setup utility.
  /usr/local/bin/vslauncher
      The vegastrike save game and mission selection utility
  /usr/local/bin/vegasettings
      Internal installer program
  /usr/local/share/vegastrike
      The vegastrike data files
  /usr/local/lib/man/man1
      Directory containg the manual files
  ~/.vegastrike
      Directory containing user specific data managed by vegastrike.
  ~/.vegastrike/vegastrike.config
      User-specific configuration file
```

## Compiling Vegastrike

## Saving some space while downloading

The Vega Strike Engine Source repository contains a lot of history not all of which is relevant to current developers if they want to quickly download and build something.
By default, the full clone will download over 800 MB of data. There are several options to minimize this:

1. Download a compressed copy of the source from the release
2. Download a master.zip from GitHub
3. Do a shallow clone using the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:vegastrike/Vega-Strike-Engine-Source.git --shallow-since=2023-09-27
```

This will produce a significantly smaller download - in the order of 22-30 MB; well over a 10x reduction.

### Compiling On Linux

1. Install the development dependencies:

   a. Run `sudo script/bootstrap`

   b. *OR* install the dependencies manually. For Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE Leap, Fedora, and Rocky Linux, you should be able to reference the contents of the bootstrap script to determine what dependencies to install yourself.


   On Funtoo(-current):

     Most dependencies are already met with a standard desktop Funtoo install. In particular, you want to make sure your "flavor" is set to desktop,
     and that you have a proper "mix-in" depending on the desktop manager you use. Check your current profile:

     ```bash
     sudo epro show
     ```

     and if you don't have the desktop flavor enabled, enable it with

     ```bash
     sudo epro flavor desktop
     ```

     Also enable the proper mix-in for your desktop manager; for instance xfce:

     ```bash
     sudo epro mix-in +xfce (or gnome, kde etc)
     ```

     All of the steps above are outlined in the Funtoo installation guide at <https://www.funtoo.org/Install/Profiles> and you should have done it
     already in the process of installing desktop Funtoo. The only dependency that you have to install manually is OpenAL:

     ```bash
     sudo emerge media-libs/openal
     ```

   After that you are ready to compile.

2. Build Vega Strike:

   a. Use the `build` bash script in the `script` directory.

   b. *OR* configure and compile VS manually, using the ncurses ccmake frontend:

   ```bash
   mkdir build & cd build
   ccmake ..
   # (configure/edit options to taste in ccmake, press 'c' to save the selected options
   # and press 'g' to update the build configuration files used by the make build tool)
   cmake --build ./build -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) # (where the getconf clause returns the number of available CPU threads/cores on the system)
   mkdir ../bin && cp vegastrike-engine ../bin/ && cp setup/vegasettings ../bin/ && cd ..
   ```

   c. *OR* configure and compile VS manually, using the command-line cmake frontend:

   ```bash
   mkdir build & cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build ./build -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) # (where the getconf clause returns the number of available CPU threads/cores on the system)
   mkdir ../bin && cp vegastrike-engine ../bin/ && cp setup/vegasettings ../bin/ && cd ..
   ```

   __TIPS__:

   To enable verbose output for debugging purposes (will show compilation commands), pass the `--verbose` argument, where supported:

   ```bash
   cmake --build ./build --verbose
   ```

   To enable/disable compile-time options with cmake, use `cmake -D<option>=<value>`. Example:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DENABLE_PIE=ON -DUSE_PYTHON_3=ON -DCPU_SMP=2 -DCPUINTEL_native=ON -CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   ```

   __NOTE__:

   On some Ubuntu versions and derivatives, a bug exists whereby enabling
   PIE compilation (Position Independent Executables) results in the
   `file` utility incorrectly recognising the compiled vegastrike binary
   as a shared library instead of a position independent shared executable
   object.

   The effect of the bug is that vegastrike can still be started from the
   command line but that it will not be recognised as an executable by GUI
   file managers such as Nautilus and Dolphin.

   To avoid this scenario, turn off this flag by default and let packagers
   on other distributions turn this on if their OS is able to correctly deal
   with Position Independent Executables.

   For more info, see:

   - <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file/+bug/1747711>
   - <https://github.com/vegastrike/Vega-Strike-Engine-Source/issues/94>

3. Download a copy of the assets/game data from [here](https://github.com/vegastrike/Assets-Production). You can either `git clone` this repository, or download it as a ZIP file and unzip it.

4. When you run vegasettings, specify the path to the assets/game data on the command line with `--target` followed by a space. E.g.:

   ```bash
   ./bin/vegasettings --target $(pwd)/../Assets-Production
   ```

   The absolute path may need to be supplied, rather than a relative path.

   Do the same with vegastrike-engine using `-d` and no space. E.g.:

   ```bash
   ./bin/vegastrike-engine -d$(pwd)/../Assets-Production
   ```

If there are any problems with this installation method,
please create an issue with the Vega Strike development team
by [posting a new issue](https://github.com/vegastrike/Vega-Strike-Engine-Source/issues).

### Compiling On Windows

Vega Strike is now compiling on Windows! There are also installers available for Windows 10 and Windows 11, as of Vega Strike v0.9.0-beta1. If you want to try it out and perhaps offer feedback, that would certainly be welcome.

To compile Vega Strike on Windows, start by installing either Visual Studio 2022 or just the Visual Studio 2022 Developer Tools. When selecting the Workloads and Components to install, include at least "C++ for Desktop" and a recent build of the Windows SDK. Probably Git and the GitHub for Windows extension also. Install the latest Visual Studio updates as well.

Once the Visual Studio Installer finishes, reboot your computer. Then, find `Developer PowerShell for VS 2022` on the Start menu; alt-click it ("right-click"); and choose "Run as Administrator." Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` (or another suitable PowerShell Execution Policy of your choice). Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm. Exit PowerShell. Now reopen `Developer PowerShell for VS 2022`, this time without Admin privileges, and run `script/bootstrap.ps1`. Once that finishes, reboot your computer again. Finally, open `Developer PowerShell for VS 2022` one more time, and run `script/build.ps1 -Generator VS2022Win64`.

Assuming all the above steps succeed, you are now ready to run Vega Strike. Note that `vegasettings` is not currently building on Windows, so you will need to edit `vegastrike.config` manually as needed.

Finally, note that the location of the `.vegastrike` folder has changed since v0.5.1r1. It will now be located here: `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\.vegastrike`.

### Compiling On MacOS

VegaStrike is now compiling on macOS as well! macOS 13 is the only version that we officially support at the moment, but the game will build and run on other macOS versions as well.

Please note: We only support Intel-based Macs (x86_64) at this time. Help adding Apple Silicon support would be appreciated.

To install the required build dependencies using Homebrew, run the following:

```bash
script/bootstrap-mac.sh
```

(Or `script/bootstrap-on-macos.sh`, depending on which branch of the code you have downloaded.)

If you have MacPorts, run the following:

```bash
sudo port install python312 boost181@1.81.0_12+cmake_scripts+no_single+no_static+python312 glib2 +quartz libepoxy +quartz gtk3 +quartz libsdl2 libGLU freeglut openal-soft cmake expat libjpeg-turbo libpng libvorbis ninja

export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/local/"

echo "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"

# Keep these lines! Otherwise you will likely get PFNGL... not found errors.
ln -s "$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/include/GL" "$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/include/OpenGL"
ln -s "$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/include/GL" "$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/include/GLUT"
```

Or, if the branch you're on has the `bootstrap-on-macOS-using-MacPorts.sh` script, just run that, with sudo privileges.

3. Packaging Vega Strike:

After building Vega Strike, the packages can be built using:

```bash
make package
```

Or:

```bash
cpack ./build
```

## Gameplay

### Interstellar Warp Transit (Jump Drive)

Most starships come equipped with a warp drive. Unfortunately they can only be used at large singularities in the space-time continuum. Your computer signals these points by placing green donut-shaped wireframes in those areas.

To engage a jump drive, position your ship inside and press 'j'.

Regulations state that starships should be stopped before jumping -- disasters have resulted from starships travelling at any great speed into a jump point.

### Intrastellar SPEC Drive

To travel inside star system, the ships are equipped with a SPEC drive that allows faster-than-light travel. This allows efficient travel between planets and stations inside the same star system. To toggle it press 'Shift-A'. To activate autopilot, that will handle this automatically, press 'A'.

### Respawn

If you sadly lose your life in combat you may respawn by pressing ';'

A new starship will be created for you by Bob.

### Transfer Ship Command

If you wish to transfer command to another starship, simply press '[' to switch over.  This is useful if you have died and do not wish to call on Bob for help.

### Controls

## Modding Vega Strike

### How to make Vegastrike Missions

An example mission (this is stored in the test1.mission file)

A mission must begin with the headers:

```xml
<mission>
    <variables>
        <var name="defaultplayer" value="blue"/>
        <var name="mission_name" value="4 versus 4" />
        <var name="splashscreen" value="bad_guys_vs_good_guys.bmp" />
        <var name="system" value="sol" />
        <var name="description" value="4vs4.txt" />
    </variables>
```

Currently, all of these options are ignored except for the "system".  It loads sol.system as the star system (which is in XML and stores all present planets)

~~The only other system included in this beta release is the blank.mission, which has 1 planet, 1 sun and 2 starbases.~~ (Note by Stephen G. Tuggy 2025-01-13: I don't think this is accurate any longer.)

After this, comes the actors in the mission, the flightgroups of fighters.

```xml
        <flightgroups>
```

You must begin the flight group tag as above, and terminate it after all of your flight groups

```xml
                <flightgroup name="blue" faction="confed" type="nova" ainame="default" waves="8" nr_ships="3">
```

The name will be used later for targetting and offset purposes.  The faction is a faction listed in factions.xml (should be self-explanatory) 0 is neutral 1 is happy -1 is mad

Currently, confed and aera are the two active factions.  AI must be default in this version as no other AI scripts are yet written. (Note by Stephen G. Tuggy 2025-01-13: Is this still accurate?)  nr_ships indicates how many starships will be in this flight squadron.

```xml
            <pos x="10000.0" y="0.0" z="3000.0"/>
```

This indicates the flight group's position... be sure it is unique

```xml
            <rot x="180.0" y="180.0" z="180.0"/>
            <order order="tmptarget" target="omikron"/>
            <order priority="0" order="superiority" target="enemy"/>
            <order priority="1" order="bomber" target="omikron"/>
            <order priority="2" order="escort" target="blue"/>
```

the rest is in development

```xml
        </flightgroup>
```

you must end all flight group tags

continue with any other flightgroups... you can have as many as you want from as many named factions are you want...

```xml
      </flightgroups>
</mission>
```

### Editing AI

The AI is completely scriptable, and I have not spent all that long perfecting it.  There are included instructions about editing the AI scripts yourself.

Right now there is only 1 AI personality.  It's the "default" personality.  In the future there will be a method to assign different personalities to different starships.

2 files are responsible for the control of the "default" personality:

default.agg.xml

and

default.int.xml

default.agg.xml means the "aggressive" AI.  it controls what it does to aggressively bring its vengeance upon its target.

When editing this file in notepad, you'll notice some tags and various numbers.

The first tag, AggressiveAI has a parameter time="4"

that's how often the AI checks if it should change its strategy.  This time can be any integer value... it can revise its plan more often or less often. 4 has been good because most maneuvers can mostly complete in 4 seconds, and it's a good time to revise plans.

underneath the beginning tag exist a list of tags that describes the logic the AI uses to figure out its next strategy.

there are a number of tags you can specify for the aggressive AI: distance, threat, hull, fshield, lshield, rshield, bshield, rand.

Each tag asserts if one of the tag-values above is between min and max.

The AI needs to make a CHOICE about what it does next, so it takes a look at the list of tags and determines if any of the assertions is true.

Nested statements mean that BOTH must be true. so you can say "if the distance is at most .5 and the hull is between .25 and .75" by writing:

```xml
<distance max=".5">
  <hull min=".25" max=".75" script="afterburnerslide.xml">
  </hull>
</distance>
```

this means "if the distance is at most half the range of my guns and the hull is between 1/4 and 3/4 of its capacity, then perform an afterburner slide."

It goes down the list of such assertions and chooses the appropriate AI script to run.

The facing and movement tags fill in the gaps where NONE of the list of the assertions are true and the ship is not either turning or moving anywhere:

```xml
<facing script="turntowards.xml">
</facing>
```

at the very bottom the `</AggressiveAI>` must show up to indicate that the AIscript has terminated.

The aggressive.int.xml is written out exactly the same as the aggressive.agg.xml

the difference is that scripts listed here INTERRUPT the current action!

An example from the game is:

```xml
<AggressiveAI close=".05">
  <hull max = ".5" script="evade.xml">
   <threat min=".4" script="afterburnerslide.xml">
   </threat>
  </hull>

  <distance max=".03" script="turnaway.xml">
  <!-- distance less than .1-->
  </distance>

</AggressiveAI>
```

this says:

If the hull is at most half and someone is threatening me with a 40% chance to hit... then evade and then afterburner slide

OR

if someone is at most .03 of my max range away from me TURN AWAY!

this will interrupt the current progress of any scripts

So that's how to use AI scripts.

If you want to know more about writing actual maneuvers (like turnaway.xml which as you can see is in the directory) please contact me at hellcatv@hotmail.com

you need to have a heavy background in vector math.

### Hacking Vega Strike

In this guide, any coding is located in square brackets ([]).
Number values may not be accurate.

#### Guide 1: Hacking cash

Step 1
Locate your saved files. (Windows: C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Local\.vegastrike\save||||Mac: (disk)>Users>(user)>.vegastrike>saves>(savefile))

Step 2
Open the files using a text editing program (preferably Notepad++).

Step 3
On the first line, you should see something roughly resembling this: [Crucible/Cephid_17^200000.000000^Llama.begin 119990000070.992740 -8999928.351833 -109989999927.749450]
On this line, find the numbers surrounded by carets “^”. This is your cash. Change it to what you want, preferably in the high millions. Or possibly even trillions. Go nuts.

Step 4
In order for the game not to go mad about this, you need to add this ending:[.000000]
Basically, if you have, say a quadrillion cash (1000000000000000) you still need to add .000000 on the end, making it stupidly long. Yes, we know, it's annoying.

Step 5
Now you need to check if you are using commas or “‘” in your cash. Don’t.
Then save the file. .txt files work, however when you see them on the loading screen they end in .txt.

Step 6
You’re now richer than a very rich man on International very rich day! Yay!

#### Guide 2: Getting the ship of your dreams

Step 1
Get your saved file from Guide 1.

Step 2
Now, find the cash (numbers in carets “^”). There is a name after this. At the start of the game, it is always “Llama.begin”.

Step 3
Now you can change this name into any ship you like. However, it must be in the same format.

Step 4
Here are some good ships:
Goddard.milspec
Clydesdale.stock
Hyena.stock (Light, weak fighter. Good for getting used to combat with other fighters.)
Mule.stock (trader)

Step 5
There is a ship list either in the game files or on the internet, check that out for some good models. (remember: add .stock or .milspec on the end!!!! (milspec is only on some specialised ships)) Finally, save the file as before.
