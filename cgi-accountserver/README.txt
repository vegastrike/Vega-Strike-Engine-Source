Step 1.
Copy settings.sample.py to settings.py

Step 2.
Change the data_path at the top to your Vega Strike data4.x directory.

Step 3.
Set your IP address for the default server.
This includes support for other "mods" or multiple servers per system,
but for general use you don't need mods.

Step 4.
Make a folder to store saved games.
Under the file_dbconfig, set up a path where saved games are to be stored.

On a web server, switch it to use a MySQL database.

Step 5.
For each 'mod', you can make a folder inside the units/ folder containing
a copy of units.csv, factions.xml and New_Game, with custom mod settings.
