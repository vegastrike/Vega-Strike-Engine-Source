/* Note: This "color.h" file is NOT meant as a general color library, by any stretch. Only those color
 * manipulation functions that are used in vs_cubemap_gen are implemented. We try to be minimalistic
 * and fast. The latter is why you see these are not classes but structs; and there are no defined
 * destructors; to make sure these types are treated as POD's by the compiler. It is also the reason
 * they are RGBA rather than RGB. We don't use the alpha channel, as of this writing; but by adding a
 * fourth channel we make sure their alignment is just right.
