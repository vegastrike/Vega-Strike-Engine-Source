/*
* This class is a functor that is created for each texel of the target texture. It's operator()() takes a ray
* as input and returns a color. Computing this color is not trivial, however: It must iterate trough the source
* texels within a given angular radius of the ray, and accumulate light and "weights". The weight for each
* source texel is a product of its filter angle based weight --Phong: weight = pow( cos(angle), shininess )--,
* and the solid angle of that source texel, as perceived from the center of the cube.
