# csvimport.py
# Rewritten by: geoscope
# This file opens units.csv (or another similar file), and a <unitname>.csv file (created most likely with csvexport.py
# it looks within units.csv for a line with the <unitname> key, and if found, updates that line to whatever information
# is is the <unitname>.csv file.
# Caveats: This script ONLY changes existing records, it does NOT add records.
#		This makes sense, since placing the new unit in a specific record location would be problematic.
#		New units could only be appended to the end of units.csv, which is not a good way to keep it organized.
#		TODO: Can this be fixed, thus making adding and inserting new units feasible?
#	   If units.csv does not already contain a key == <unitname>, then the information is not changed in units.csv
#		This uses the commandline <unitname> not the key within the file...
#		This makes changing the key itself possible, if the key in <unitfile>.csv is different.
#	   But if <unitname>.csv has a key that is different than the name of <unitname>, the key in units.csv
#		is changed and <unitname>.csv will no longer work to update units.csv, unless it is renamed as well.
#		Which it now is. 16 Aug 2006
# TODO: Command-line option -all, to import all <filename>.csv files in a directory into units.csv.
#	Turn this file's funtions into class methods
#	Gradually moving towards combining csv.py, csvexport.py and csvimport.py into one file
#		of 3 related classes, possibly with inheritance. With a wrapper python script to access
#		the classes and their methods.
#	I am doing this in preparation for next step in a csv editor, which in turn will lead to a
#		units IDE.
