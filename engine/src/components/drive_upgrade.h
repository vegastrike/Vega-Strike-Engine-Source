/** A DriveUpgrade applies a modifier to Drive class.
 *  This is a unique use case from other components, as allowing a slow
 *  ship (e.g. cargo) to upgrade to a fighter engine would break both
 *  game balance and believability. 
 *  The game previously supported both additive and multiplicative upgrades.
 *  I've removed the additive one for simplicity's sake.
