/**
 * Order is the base class for all orders.  All orders inherit from Order
 * Each fighter may have an order they are currently executing. Orders naturally
 * can queue other orders, and decide which orders may be executed in parallel by those orders' bit codes.
 * Orders affect their "parent" and may call any function within that parent
 * Limitation (perhaps resolvable) Orders do not "know" what their parent
 * is until Execute() time.  Perhaps "SetParent" Should be made virtual so that
 * various variables may be set earlier than at every execution time
