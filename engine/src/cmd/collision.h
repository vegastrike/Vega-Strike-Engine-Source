/* Rather than implement collision as part of unit as Collidable,
 * I chose to implement a class for the collision itself.
 * The reactToCollision method creates two collision object instances,
 * one for each unit.
 * It is used to reduce duplication of code, as much of the code is simple duplication.
 * Because some variables rely on previous calculations using both units,
 * we do initialization in stages.
