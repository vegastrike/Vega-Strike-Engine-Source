//Callback called when modal dialog closes.
//The callback has 3 parameters:
//1. The controller.  This can be used to interrogate the controller or the
//controls in the window for more complex dialogs.
//2. The string "id".  This is specified by the dialog creator to help handling
//code identify which dialog is responding.
//3. The integer "result".  A simple result from the dialog.  More complex
//results could be obtained from the window.
//The callback returns true if the window is to be closed, false otherwise
//(it will then return true on a later callback).

//This class controls a modal "dialog" with the user.  It puts up a modal
//window, gets an answer, and calls a callback function.
//Like all WindowController's, by default, this object deletes itself when
//the window closes.
//Note that this class requires a callback because there is no access to the
//GLUT event loop.  The common way to implement modal UI is to recursively
//call the event loop while the modal UI is showing, so that the UI can
//return directly back to the routine that called it.  Can't do that in GLUT,
//so there is no way to return a value to the caller.  The caller must
//eventually exit back to the event loop to get the modal UI serviced.
