//For some reason, the cumulative width of GLUT strings is smaller than the
//actual width when they are painted.  If we add this factor to the reference
//length of every GLUT character, things work a lot better.
//It looks like the reason is that the return type for getting GLUT reference lengths
//is int, and the lengths are not int.  The character drawing code lets GLUT move the
//origin for each character, and it looks like that movement is not integer in the
//reference char space (it's clearly not going to be integer in the scaled space).
