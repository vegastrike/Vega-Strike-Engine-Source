//See cpp file for detailed descriptions of classes, functions, etc.

//This class is used to draw text in a rectangle.  It is not a Control, just a
//repository of text attributes and behavior.  The line spacing is the same as the
//Font size.  Multi-line text starts at the top-left of the rectangle, and continues
//for as many lines a necessary.  Single-line text is centered vertically, and an
//ellipsis is added at the end of the visible text if the text must be clipped to
//fit in the rectangle.
//This object can be used to calculate, say, the bounding box of some text without
//needing to actually draw it.
//This class supports a simple language embedded in the text that can be used to
//change some attributes fo sections of text.

//This class allows a number of formatting characters.  Here are the rules:
//-- The formatting char is "#".
//-- Format commands are indicated by a single character, which is case-sensitive.
//-- The results of errors in the formatting commands is not defined.
//-- Commands can take no parameter, a required param, or an optional param.
//-- Commands that take parameters always end with another "#".
//-- Some kinds of format state are pushed onto a stack.  You can pop the stack back
//to the previous value, or reset to the original value.
//##: One "#".  "This is door ##3."
//#n[line-space]#:  Break a line here.  Optional floating-point parameter which is the
//line spacing between the current line and the next line only.  (This doesn't
//affect line spacing after the current line.)
//0.0, for instance, would results in overwriting the same line, 2.0 is double-space.
//"First line.#n#Second line."  "Double space#n2#line#n#line 2".
//#l<line-spacing>#:  Set the amount of space between lines.  Parameter is not optional.
//This command does not break the line, it just sets the line spacing for the
//following lines.  There isn't a stack associated with this setting.
//#b[stroke-weight]#: "Bold".  "Push" the font stroke weight.  Parameter has same semantics
//as Font object -- floating-point.  Default stroke weight is BOLD_STROKE.
//"#b#Price:#-b $50,000"  "I must #b4.5#emphasize#!b this."
//#c<color-spec>#: "Push" a new text color (doesn't change the background color).
//Specify R, then B, G, A as floating-point values between 0 and 1.0 (same spec as
//GFXColor).  The value are separated by ":", and A is optional.  Default for A
//is 1.0.
//"This is #c1:0:0#red#-c."
//#-{bc}:  "Pop" a font/color off the appropriate stack.  Restores previous value.
//See font and color examples above.
//#!{bc}:  "Reset" font/color to the original version.  Same parameters as "#-".

//Helper function.  Pass in RGB values, get out a color command string for those values.
