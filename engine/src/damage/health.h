/**
 * @brief The Health struct represents the health of something.
 * It can be a shield, armor, hull or subsystem.
 * @details
 * More specifically, it represents the health of DamageableFacet.
 * If the health of a non-regenerative facet is zero, it is destroyed.
 * If this facet is the sole facet of a DamageableLayer, it is destroyed.
 * If this DamageableLayer is mortal, the whole DamageableObject is destroyed.
 * Therefore, destroying the hull of a ship destroys it.
 * But, destroying the reactor or life-support of a ship also disabled it,
 * killing everyone inside,
 * potentially without actually destroying the ship.
