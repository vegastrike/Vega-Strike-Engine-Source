/**
 * @brief The FacetConfiguration enum represents how many facets a layer has and it what configuration.
 * @details The use of enum class enforces the correctness of the parameter without checking.
 * You can't pass 17 for example.
 * I debated keeping the existing dual/quad but as it turns out, dual is Greek and Quad is latin.
 * It is also easier to understand five and six than penta and sexta (No! Hexa! Mixed again!).
 * This can also be extended to other facet configurations, such as pyramid
 * (left, right, top, bottom and back).
 *
 * For consistency's sake, always start left to right, top to bottom and finally front to back.
 * That is x,y,z. This is also how both core vector and Vector class are ordered.
