 * Source abstract class

 *      This base class implements the majority of the functions required
 *      for sources, specific implementations need only provide a handful
 *      of functions (impl functions) that keep their associated scene managers
 *      up to speed.
 *      @par Renderer-specific implementation goes through RenderableSource s
 *      attached to the abstract Source. Renderers are responsible for attaching
 *      RenderableSource s to abstract Sources as necessary. Many implementation
 *      functions (as play/stop/getPlayingTime) go through those renderer-specific
 *      interfaces.
