 * Renderable Listener abstract class

 * @remarks This is the interface to renderer-specific listeners.
 *      Listeners attached to a renderer receive one such instance
 *      that allows listener-specific commands to be given to the
 *      renderer, like requesting position updates and such.
 * @note Since this mutual attachment would create circular references,
 *      it is implemented on this side with raw pointers. No problem should arise since
 *      the smart pointer used in abstract listener already handles everything correctly,
 *      but care must be had not to have detached renderable listeners around.
