/**
 * Audio Scene Manager.
 *
 * @remarks Use it to create and manage sources, listeners, instantiate source templates,
 *      scenes, and other various scene management tasks.
 *      @par SceneManager s will handle the complex task of prioritizing sources, managing
 *      source channels, volume levels, and doing all kinds of culling.
 *      @par Another responsability of scene managers is the manipulation and analysis of
 *      environments to feed environmental information to capable renderers.
 *      @par Inactive sources without external references are automatically destroyed when
 *      they become permanently inactive (notice this requirement is merely approximate -
 *      implementations are free to make reasonable approximations for the determination
 *      of such condition as "permanently inactive"). This allows for "fire & forget" sources,
 *      where the source is activated (by calling startPlaying), and then immediately
 *      unreferenced. The SceneManager will keep track of that source, as it would any other,
 *      until it stops playing (make sure though it's not a looping source!), and will remove
 *      it when that happens, freeing any associated resources.
 *      @par In fact this is so common as to make it part of the API: playSource does exactly
 *      that, it creates a source, plays it, and discards the reference.
 *      @par Thus, SceneManager s are the hub of all activity relating sound. If you're doing
 *      anything bypassing the SceneManager, you're doing it wrong.
 *      @par This class is NOT abstract, it provides a very basic implementation that does
 *      nothing special.
 * @note You must set a renderer or you won't hear anything ;)
