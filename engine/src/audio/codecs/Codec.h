     *      when asked to suggest codecs for a file, a null value can be returned
     *      asking the registry to always try this codec. This is useful if the codec
     *      can handle many (perhaps unknown) file types, or if there is no associated
     *      extension to the type handled.
     *      @par The base implementation does just that - returns null.
     *      @par It is expected that files named with returned extensions will pass the
     *      tests for canHandle(path,false). Though this may not always be true. So
     *      the final test canHandle(path,true) should never be skipped, even if the file

     *      implementation should rely on the filename alone to do its task

     * @remarks This member will return true when it thinks the codec can decode
     *      the specified file, and false otherwise. No certainty is required. However,
     *      an assumption is made that codec implementations will make a reasonable
     *      effort to guess the outcome of an "open" call, given the allowed operations.
     *      If canOpen is true, the implementation can open the file to inspect its
     *      format and accurately decide that. The operation is still expected to be
     *      rather quick. If canOpen is false, the operation is expected to be even
     *      quicker and the implementation may not open the file. Rather, filename
     *      patterns (or any other method that doesn't open the file) are the only
     *      viable methods of implementation, and thus it is expected that the returned
     *      value will be less accurate. Whenever in doubt, the function will return
     *      success (true).
