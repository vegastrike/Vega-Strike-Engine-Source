/* Hack to fix compiling problem with old gl.h's, reported by Steve
 *  Baker <sjbaker1@airmail.net>.  Some old gl.h's don't include glext.h, but
 *  do this:
 *
 * #define GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array    1
 *
 *  since they do define the glLockArraysEXT/glUnlockArraysEXT
 *  functions.  However, this prevents PFNGLLOCKARRAYSEXTPROC /
 *  PFNGLUNLOCKARRAYSEXTPROC from being defined in glext.h.  So, we do
 *  the following, which at worst results in a warning (and is awfully
 *  ugly):
 *
 * #undef GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array
 *
 *  The *correct* thing to do would be for gl.h to #include glext.h, as
 *  recent gl.h's do.  However, versions of Mesa as recent as 3.2.1
 *  don't do this, so we have to work around it.
