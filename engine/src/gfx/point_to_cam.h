/**
 * Calculates the way a point-like sphere should be oriented, with a given
 * input position.  Pos will be tweaked, and p,q,r to be used will be returned.
 * true will be returned if it is close enough to be rendered
 * Uses current camera orientation
 * If local_transformation is used, the object will attempt to use that to keep
 * Its own up alignment, otherwise it will match the camera up
 * If offsetbyradius is used the animation will appear closer than it is
 * If moveiftoofar is true and also offset by radius is true then the item will
 * be moved closer to the cam if it is too far and shrunken appropriately
 * Fixed 052402 to have floating -> double for important values
