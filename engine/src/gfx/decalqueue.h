/*
 * A decal is a plastic, cloth, paper, or ceramic substrate that has printed on it a pattern or image that
 * can be moved to another surface upon contact, usually with the aid of heat or water.
 *
 * The original code implemented its own ref counting. TODO:I replaced that with a singleton that holds all textures
 * until the game exits. This should be a reasonable implementation for almost all scenarios.
