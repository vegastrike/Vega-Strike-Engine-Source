"""This script takes a file path (or paths) as an argument, and rewrites the file
with the Vega Strike GPL 3 copyright notice prepended to it.

If no arguments are passed, the script will read from stdin.

The Copyright text is copied from the LICENSE file, which is assumed to be at
the root of the current git repository. Hence, this script needs to be run from
within a git repository containing a LICENSE file at the root. The lines at the
start of the LICENSE file, starting with 'Copyright (C)' and ending just before
'GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE', will be copied as the Copyright text for the GPL
notice. e.g. If the LICENSE file contains the following lines, they will be copied
in at the start of the GPL notice:

    Copyright (c) 2001-2002 Daniel Horn
    Copyright (c) 2002-2019 pyramid3d and other Vega Strike Contributors
