#
# THIS SCRIPT MUST BE RUN AS ROOT
# This script *should* build, from the seperate vegastrike modules, a full RPM (and SRPM) based
# release for your automagic pleasure :-)
#
# First, make sure that you have all the required modules present in this relative position to this script:
#       ../data
#       ../vegastrike        NO OTHER DIRECTORIES SHOULD BE PRESENT IN THIS PARENT DIRECTORY
#       ../music
# You should also have placed, in the data directory, the vslauncher binary, and in the vegastrike dir,
# the vegasettings binary.
# Now, make sure that the vegastrike source is prepared for compile, including the removal of all non-essential
# directories (such as objconv, launcher and the extra boost dir -- depending on your srpm options).  And make
# sure the data dir is also ready, by removing all non-linux files from all modules -- some of this is accounted
# for in this script, some is not (see Removing Windows/Mac junk).  This will minimise srpm and rpm file size.
#
# Now, before you launch this script, make sure that the .spec files are up to date with version, release and builder,
# and that the included documentation (man, info etc) are up to date for this version.
#
# Finally, make sure that you know the SRCPATH for your system.  This path should contain the directories:
# BUILD  RPMS  SOURCES  SPECS  SRPMS
# In RedHat for example, it is /usr/src/redhat

SRCPATHDEFAULT="/usr/src"

# And make sure you know the program that can build RPMs -- mainly either /usr/bin/rpm or /usr/bin/rpmbuild

RPMBUILDERDEFAULT="/usr/bin/rpm"

# Now, simply run this script! :-)
#
#
